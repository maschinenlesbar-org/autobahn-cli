// Conformance test P8 + P9 + P13 (fix plan 2026-10-06): a body is decoded by its declared
// charset (P8); a 2xx body without the documented shape is a parse error, never data or
// "nothing found" (P9); every rejected input is the library's validation error, never a raw
// TypeError or RangeError (P13). Shared across the *-cli repos; only the adapter differs.
